# restore-twitter-icon
Restore the old Twitter logo with a Chromium extension

## How to use it
Download the .zip file of this repository (you can [click here](https://github.com/Dinoosauro/restore-twitter-icon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) and unzip it. the .crx file of the extension. Then, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and enable the "Developer Mode" toggle. Click now on the "Load unpacked extension" button, and select the extracted folder. Now, refresh your Twitter tab and you should see the new Twitter logo.
## Safety
You can check the source code if (understandably) you don't want to trust someone you've never heard before, they're just a few lines of code. The source code probably could be written better, but I quickly made this, and, as long as it works, I think it's fine.
## Trademarks
This extension has no affiliation with Twitter and X. Corp.
